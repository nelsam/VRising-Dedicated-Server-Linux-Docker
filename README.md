# VRising Dedicated Server Linux Docker
Run a VRising Dedicated Server on Linux via Docker

1. `git clone https://github.com/smb1982/VRising-Dedicated-Server-Linux-Docker.git`
2. `cd VRising-Dedicated-Server-Linux-Docker`
3. `./run-server.sh`

Now this will probably take a few minutes as it will:

- Build the base docker image (10-20 mins)
- Download the VRising Dedicated Server from Steam (~1.6GB)
- Run the Dedicated Server for the first time (usually 5-10 minutes)

I would recommend shutting it down after it starts (You won't be able to connect
yet anyway)!

```
docker stop vRisingServer
```

Edit this file for Server Settings:

```
./VRising-Dedicated-Server-Linux-Docker/data/save-data/ServerHostSettings.json
```

At least change the Name, Port and QueryPort to match our Docker Ports (So
outside can connect), and Port forward them.

    "Name": "YOURNAME V Rising Server [Linux Dedicated]",
    "Port": 27015,
    "QueryPort": 27016,

Edit this file for the actual Game Settings:
 ```
 ./VRising-Dedicated-Server-Linux-Docker/data/save-data/ServerGameSettings.json
 ```


Once you're happy, simply run;
 
 ```
 ./VRising-Dedicated-Server-Linux-Docker/run-server.sh
 ```
 
And get to Vampirising! (The script will always make sure the server is up to
date before running it!)
